Version: 0.3.1
Date: 2025-09-20
  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed atomic-rockets being invisible when fired from a Spidertron while in "automatic" fire mode, while the Quality mod is present
    - Corrected the orientation of atomic-rockets when fired from a Spidertron to not always be the same direction as the target
      - Vanilla behavior is for rockets to be fired initially in the direction the Spidertron's head is facing
      - Orientation is still slightly off if manually firing from a Spidertron, working on this

Version: 0.3.0
Date: 2025-09-19
  Minor Features:
    - Atomic-bombs/atomic-rockets are now affected by quality if the "quality" mod is installed
      - Quality now also affects the AoE and Repeat modifiers of a nuclear explosion; i.e. more dakka, bigger boom
    - Added ICBMs
      - Allows the launching of atomic-warheads (and optionally, atomic-bombs) via a rocket-silo to a designated target
        -> Target designated via the new ICBM-remote, unlocked from researching ICBMs
        -> Launches from the closest rocket-silo, with a valid payload (atomic bomb/rocket and/or atomic warhead), to the designated target
      - Added rocket-control-units and guidance systems research
        - The further the target is from the launching rocket-silo, the more likely the ICBM  will deviate off course
          -> Optional, "Perfect Guidance" option prevents any deviation, ignoring research level
        - Guidance systems research reduces the probability of target deviation by %10 each level (10 levels), i.e. at level 10, ICBMs will never deviate off target
          -> Guidance deviation threshold setting is the base chance that an ICBM will not deviate off target while en route (checked every 8 chunks worth of distance to target)
      - Unlocked after researching space, production, and utility science
      - Distance to/time to target are affected by planet magnitude
        -> i.e. the larger the magnitude, the larger the planet, thus the longer it takes an ICBM to reach its target
        -> vice-versa for a smaller planet
        -> Nauvis has a magnitude of 1; Space Age Planets: Vulcanus = 1.5, Gleba = 1.1, Aquilo = 1, Fulgora = 0.9
    - Added, optional and configurable, atomic warhead
      - Much more expensive (by default, configurable) than an atomic bomb, and can only be used via a rocket-silo, but can remotely target any position on the same surface as the launching rocket-silo (interplanetary ballistic missiles are on my todo list for the future)
      - Distinct from the atomic bomb, but (should) have equivalent matching configurable settings
    - Added optional "Nuclear" ammo category
      -> If disabled (default), atomic bombs/rockets and the atomic warhead default to the "projectile" ammo category, benefitting instead from explosive weapons damage research (Vanilla behavior)
      - Separate category specifically for the atomic-bomb and atomic-warhead
      - Allows for/adds, configurable, inifinite research for nuclear weapons damage

Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2025-09-12
  Minor Features:
    - Added additional, optional, "Fire wave" setting
      -> Things in the blast radius will be set on fire
    - Added additional settings for the atomic-bomb item
      - Range_Modifier -> Multiplier of the range at which nukes can be fired from a rocket launcher, default = 1.5
      - Cooldown_Modifier -> Multiplier of the cooldown between firing shots, default = 10
      - Stack_Size -> Stack size of atomic-bombs, default = 10
      - Weight_Modifier -> Multiplier of the atomic-bomb's weight; affects whether they can be launched into orbit or not, default = 1.5 * tons
    - Added additional settings for the atomic-bomb recipe
      - Crafting_time -> Crafting time, in seconds, for one crafting cycle of the atomic-bomb recipe
      - Input_Multiplier -> Multiplier of the quantity needed for each input item to the atomic-bomb recipe
      - Result_Count -> Number of atomic-bombs created from one crafting cycle
      - Recipe -> String setting used to define the recipe and amounts for each ingredient for the atomic-bomb recipe
      - i.e.
        -> Vanilla = processing-unit=10,explosives=10,uranium-235=30
        -> Space Age = processing-unit=10,explosives=10,uranium-235=100
        -> Custom Defined = item-name-1=amount-1,item-name-2=amount-2,item-name-3=amount-3, etc...
      - Recipe_Allow_None
        -> Whether to fallback to the default vanilla recipe if none of the provided ingredients can be found
        -> Allows for free crafting of nukes if enabled with no recipe set (i.e. an empty string)
